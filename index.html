                                Hi! I am a PhD student at the University College London (UCL),
                                working with Prof. Phyllis Illari and Prof. Jack Stilgoe.
                                I'm interested in understanding how responsibility is played out around AI technologies.
                                This includes various factors, for instance:
                                <ul style="padding-top:0.5em;margin-top: 0;">
                                    <li>What conversations are happening, and what conversations are being given funding
                                        and space?
                                    </li>
                                    <li>What is happening in industry?
                                    </li>
                                    <li>What are governments saying and doing?
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Who gets a say?
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>

                            <p>
                                For my PhD, I want to engage with industry actors to learn what issues of responsibility
                                they are dealing
                                with in the creation and deployment of AI technologies. I'm keen to understand what
                                things they
                                problematise, what processes they use to combat these, and whether measures that they
                                employ make a difference
                                to the end products that they produce.
                                I'm excited to have recently collected my empirical data. My chosen method of
                                data collection
                                is semi-structured interviews, and have two case studies: an AI company, and a medical AI company.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I'm lucky to be working with both Phyllis, a philosopher of science, and Jack, a
                                sociologist
                                of science. As their areas of expertise are different, they are able to give me rich
                                reflections on my project. Having both of them on board is especially helpful as the
                                space around AI and responsibility
                                is an interdisciplinary one. With the help of my supervisors, I'm excited to be able to
                                engage
                                with literatures from various disciplinary backgrounds.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                More broadly, I'm also interested in many other areas of Science & Technology
                                ethics, and
                                Science & Technology policy.

                            </p>

                                Recently, I have been a visiting researcher with Prof. Paul Nightingale at the Science
                                Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at
                                the University of Sussex. Before that, I was a regulatory intern at Aidence, where I
                                worked with them on the implementation of ISO standards and
                                the then incoming EU AI Act.
                            </p>

                                In my free time, I enjoy pottery, calligraphy, and lifting weights</a>.
